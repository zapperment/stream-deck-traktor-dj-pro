 * A trigger action is for keys on the Stream Deck that send a MIDI message to Traktor when pressed down,
 * but not when released. When released, the key image is updated to show that it is not pressed down.
 * A â€œhandleKeyUp" function is not necessary, because not MIDI message is sent when the key is released.
 * Examples for this type of key: jump, load, tempo.
