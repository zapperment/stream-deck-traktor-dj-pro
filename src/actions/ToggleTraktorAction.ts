/**
 * A toggle action is for keys on the Stream Deck that send a MIDI message to Traktor when pressed down,
 * but not when released. The MIDI message sent on key down toggles the state of a Traktor element on or
 * off with each key press. The key image is not updated when the key is released, this is handled by Traktor
 * via MIDI message. A â€œhandleKeyUp" function is not necessary, because not MIDI message is sent when the
 * key is released. Examples for this type of key: loop, loop control, play, stop.
